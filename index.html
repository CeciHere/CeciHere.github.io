  <h1><bold>Hi there, this is Cecilia</bold></h1>
  <p><small>(You can really just call me CC!)</small></p>
  <p>Who Am I?</p>
  <p>I'm currently a Human Resources Management student studying in Toronto. Welcome to my little headspace.</p>
  <p>These are the self assigned tasks/projects I'm currently trying work on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Being Organized</li>
      <li>Coding (in general)</li>
      <li>Drawing: on paper and maybe (gasp!) on the computer</li>
    </ul>
  <p>Although those are only a few things I want to do, if I had a table, WHICH I DO!</p>
  <Table border="5">
    <tr>
      <th colspan="2">
        <h2><br><What I Want to Work On, Since Self-Improvement is So Attractive!</br></h2>
      </th>
    </tr>
    <th><italics>Order</italics></th>
    <th><italics>What I Want to Work On</italics></th>
